# Automated-Workflow-for-Protein-Ligand-LIE-Linear-Interaction-Energy-Calculations
Automated workflow using Q6 MD to perform Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) calculations. It prepares protein-ligand systems, runs simulations of complex and ligand in solution, extracts interaction energies, and calculates binding free energies, enabling fast, consistent, and reproducible affinity predictions.
